title = "Versuchenstadt";
description = "A small custom map, that's mostly a proof of concept. This map contains most features from a normal Campaign/Adventure map. You can play the map by selecting it through the mission selection screen in the Keep or you can start a recruit game with the chat command "/versuchenstadt".

Currently the boss spawns for this map do not work but the patrol spawns do.
This mod loads in all assets from the \"Screaming Bell\" and \"Horn of Magnus\" maps, so there may be some stability issues on lower end hardware.

This mod's source code can be found [url=https://github.com/dalokraff/TestTown]here[/url]";
